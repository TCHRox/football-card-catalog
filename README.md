# Football Card Archive v5

This version is tailored to your current Google Sheet layout.

## Expected sheet structure

- Column A = first name
- Column B = last name
- Column C = year
- Column D = rookie card? (`Y` or `N`)
- Column E = brand
- Column F = type
- Column G = set number
- Column H = quantity owned
- Column O = notes

The site now combines first and last name into the player title and shows `RC` when the rookie column is `Y`.

## Notes

- The site is hardcoded to Google Sheet gid `1796597612`.
- Team and Grade filters are hidden because the current sheet does not use those fields.
- Collection Value and Total Cost automatically hide if the sheet does not have those columns.
- `card-images.json` is where internet-sourced card images can be attached without editing the sheet.

## Example card image mapping

The file includes one seeded example for:

De'Von Achane 2023 Phoenix Base 130

## v6 changes

- Player names now use spreadsheet-style fill-down behavior.
- If Column A (first name) or Column B (last name) is blank, the site uses the most recent nonblank value above it.
- This means all cards beneath a player heading remain assigned to that player until a new name appears.
- Example behavior supplied for verification:
  - Row 15 inherits Davante Adams
  - Row 37 inherits Troy Aikman
  - Row 74 inherits Josh Allen
- The inherited names are also used for image matching and search.
